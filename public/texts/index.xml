      <title>Thoughts on the Metric System: An Immigrant’s Perspective</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve long intended to write about the comparison between the metric and American measurement systems. It’s a topic that periodically resurfaces in American discourse, often sparking passionate debates about tradition versus global standardization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s fascinating to reflect on how my own attitude towards this debate has evolved. When I first arrived in America, I had to adapt to these unfamiliar measurements, and I initially resisted. “What’s with all these illogical units?” I thought. It wasn’t even the individual measures that bothered me most — after all, what’s inherently wrong with an inch, and how is a centimeter radically better? No, it was the seeming lack of logic in the system as a whole that irked me. Why are there 12 inches in a foot but three feet in a yard? And then 16 ounces in a pound? It all seemed arbitrary and inexplicable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>It’s fascinating to reflect on how my own attitude towards this debate has evolved. When I first arrived in America, I had to adapt to these unfamiliar measurements, and I initially resisted. “What’s with all these illogical units?” I thought. It wasn’t even the individual measures that bothered me most — after all, what’s inherently wrong with an inch, and how is a centimeter radically better? No, it was the seeming lack of logic in the system as a whole that irked me. Why are there 12 inches in a foot but three feet in a yard? And then 16 ounces in a pound? It all seemed arbitrary and inexplicable.</p>
<p>And don’t get me started on the obsession with fractions — all those sixteenths and thirty-seconds, it’s maddening! I remember a real-life problem I encountered at the post office: I needed to choose a box for a package. Two boxes cost the same, but their sizes were different: one was 11&quot; x 8–1/2&quot; x 5–1/2&quot;, and the other was 11–7/8&quot; x 3–3/8&quot; x 13–5/8&quot;. The question was: which one has a larger volume? Try calculating that in your head! I began to wonder if American schoolchildren were taught some secret techniques for multiplying fractions, which were unknown to us decimal users. Spoiler alert: they aren’t.</p>
<p>Then there’s Fahrenheit! In Celsius, it seems so straightforward: zero is when water freezes, and 100 is when it boils. But Fahrenheit? The zero point seems arbitrary (it was actually the coldest temperature Fahrenheit could achieve in his laboratory, about -18°C). The distance from zero to the water’s freezing point is divided into 32 degrees. Then, he set the boiling point of water at 212 degrees because the 180-degree span between freezing and boiling is conveniently divisible by many fractions. Again, with the non-decimal fractions!</p>
<p>As time passed, however, my perspective began to shift. One summer, I dove into various woodworking projects — building flower beds, decking, etc. Suddenly, I realized it felt natural to think about lumber in feet and inches. The width in inches is expressed in single-digit numbers: boards 4, 6, or 8 inches wide are standard, occasionally 10 inches. Lengths of 6 or 8 feet are also convenient, single-digit numbers. Using meters and centimeters would have been far more complicated. I surprised myself with this realization.</p>
<p>The same goes for bolts and nuts. Inch and half-inch bolts make sense, but what about the tiny ones? Surely we don’t resort to thirty-seconds of an inch? It turns out we don’t need to. Small bolts are simply numbered: #2, #4, #6, up to #12. After that, it’s a quarter-inch and up. Sounds crazy, right? But once you get used to it, it’s not so bad. You learn to visualize what a #6 bolt looks like — just a tad smaller than #8. It becomes second nature.</p>
<p>I had another epiphany during a trip to Canada. I’d always claimed that miles bothered me least of all American measurements — the speedometer shows miles, and road signs display distances in miles. You look, you calculate, and you’re done. But in Canada, I discovered that I wasn’t calculating at all — I had developed an intuitive feel for miles. I’d see a road sign saying “20 km ahead” and suddenly arrive at my destination, thinking, “That was quick!” I realized I had been estimating distances in miles without even thinking about it.</p>
<p>The issue of fractions deserves special attention. When comparing metric and American systems, we often conflate two distinct aspects: the units of measurement themselves (length, weight, etc.) and how these units are subdivided. The metric system uses decimal division throughout. Convenient, right? There are 100 centimeters in a meter and 1000 grams in a kilogram. Converting between units is a breeze. The American system, however, is built on halves: halves, quarters, eighths, sixteenths, and so on. At first glance — through our decimal-tinted lenses — it seems horribly inconvenient. Adding and subtracting become cumbersome: what’s three-quarters minus seven thirty-seconds? You need to find a common denominator, and… ugh. Multiplication is even worse.</p>
<p>BUT — and this is a big but — it’s actually quite practical for everyday use. Think about it: even we “decimal people,” when we see 0.5, think “half,” and when we see 0.25, we think “quarter,” right? We don’t mentally divide the whole into 10 parts and take five of them. We just take half. For daily life, simple fractions often feel more intuitive than decimals. For calculations, decimals win hands down, but for practical applications, fractions have their merits.</p>
<p>Or do they? Let’s take another look at the fractions common in the American system: halves, quarters, eighths, sixteenths… Ring any bells? It’s essentially a binary system beloved by computers and programmers alike! Those in the know understand the computational gymnastics required for a computer to convert binary numbers to the decimal system we humans prefer.</p>
<p>Now, back to Fahrenheit. It seems like a bizarre temperature scale, not clearly anchored to anything tangible and decidedly non-decimal. Celsius appears much more logical, right? That’s why Fahrenheit is only used in three countries, while Celsius is the global standard. But let’s consider this from an everyday perspective: do I really care about water’s boiling point when I’m checking the weather? I just want to know if it’s hot or cold! In Fahrenheit, I know that zero is bone-chillingly cold, and 100 is swelteringly hot. Everything else falls between these extremes. In Celsius? Zero degrees is an ambiguous, slushy mess — neither truly cold nor warm. And 100 degrees? That’s not even a real-world temperature for the weather. Sure, scientists in labs might care about when water boils (and why water, specifically?), but for the average person, isn’t a weather-centric scale more practical?</p>
<p>So, what’s the takeaway here? Living in a different country opens your mind to new perspectives on things you once thought were set in stone. It challenges your assumptions and broadens your horizons. In my view, it’s an excellent workout for your brain and your ability to reason.</p>
<p>P.S. Don’t try to conclude from this text that I’m “for” or “against” either system. I’ve grown to appreciate them both! 🙂</p>

      <title>Machine learning with matchboxes</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/texts/matchboxes/</link>

      <description>A journey from a childhood game to machine learning principles</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I made my first machine learning project when I was 12. I used 24 matchboxes, 55 (give or take) cherry pits, gouache paint, paper, scissors, glue, and colored pencils. That was all I needed to start working with machine learning in the 1980s.</p>
<p>My dad gave me a book by Martin Gardner describing a simple game and a machine for playing it. He called the game Hexapawn because it used just six pawns on a 3x3 board.</p>
<h2 id="the-game-and-rules">The game and rules</h2>
<p>The rules are simple. Here is how Martin Gardner describes them (<a href="https://gwern.net/doc/reinforcement-learning/model-free/1991-gardner-ch8amatchboxgamelearningmachine.pdf">https://gwern.net/doc/reinforcement-learning/model-free/1991-gardner-ch8amatchboxgamelearningmachine.pdf</a> ):</p>
<p>Only two types of move are allowed:</p>
<p>(1) A pawn may advance straight forward one square to an empty square;
(2) a pawn may capture an enemy pawn by moving one square diagonally, left or right, to a square occupied by the enemy. The captured piece is removed from the board.</p>
<p>These are the same as pawn moves in chess, except that no double move, en passant capture, or promotion of pawns is permitted. The game is won in any of three ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>By advancing a pawn to the third row.</li>
<li>By capturing all enemy pieces.</li>
<li>By achieving a position in which the enemy cannot move.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-project">The project</h2>
<p>Creating a board and finding the pieces to play was the easy part. After that, I had to create the machine itself. Martin Gardner called it HER: Hexapawn Educable Robot.</p>
<p>The whole game never lasts longer than six moves. I, the human, was playing white, and the robot was playing black. So I had to give it (HER?) instructions for each even move.</p>
<p>I split twenty-four matchboxes into three groups: for moves 2, 4, and 6. Each box had a picture describing the position and the possible moves for that position for black. Each box contained several colored cherry pits according to the number of possible moves.</p>
<p><img alt="Old boxes" loading="lazy" src="/texts/matchboxes/old_boxes.webp"></p>
<p>So, I had two boxes for the second move because there were two different positions after the first move by white (three if you count the symmetrical one). I had 11 boxes for the fourth move and another 11 boxes for the sixth move.</p>
<h2 id="time-to-play-and-learn">Time to play and learn</h2>
<p>Now, the game begins! You move your white pawn, take the matchbox with your current position, shake it, and pick one colored cherry pit from it (don’t look! Pick it randomly!). You make a move for the robot using the arrow of the cherry pit’s color and put it back in the box.</p>
<p>After six moves, either you or the robot wins.</p>
<p>Now begins the learning part. If the robot loses, you “punish” it by removing the colored pit responsible for the last move. For example, in box six above, if the last move for black was “green,” then black would lose. If that was the case, you remove the green pit from the box, leaving only the winning moves. If there is only one colored pit in the box, you “punish” the box responsible for the previous (fourth) move. That way, you ensure the robot never reaches the box with only one losing move.</p>
<p>Are the rules clear? Let’s start playing and teaching the machine!</p>
<p>The machine learns surprisingly fast. If you teach it correctly, it becomes invincible after 30–40 games. Don’t believe me? Try it!</p>
<h2 id="new-generation">New generation</h2>
<p>Forty years later, I found that book by Martin Gardner.</p>
<p><img alt="Martin Gardner&rsquo;s book cover" loading="lazy" src="/texts/matchboxes/martin_gardner_cover.webp"></p>
<p>(<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Colossal-Book-Short-Puzzles-Problems/dp/0393061140/">https://www.amazon.com/Colossal-Book-Short-Puzzles-Problems/dp/0393061140/</a> ) and rebuilt the machine with my son.</p>
<p>Of course, we used a computer to create the board and move diagrams. We found colored beads in a nearby store (no need to paint cherry pits!). But the fun was the same!</p>
<p>My son published the instructions with the ready-to-use printouts you can download, cut, and glue on your matchboxes: <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Matchbox-Mini-Chess-Learning-Machine/">https://www.instructables.com/Matchbox-Mini-Chess-Learning-Machine/</a></p>
<p>They look more polished now!</p>
<p><img alt="New boxes" loading="lazy" src="/texts/matchboxes/new_boxes.webp"></p>
<h2 id="machine-learning-ideas">Machine learning ideas</h2>
<p>I hear you saying, “I thought it was a serious article about Machine Learning, but you are talking about child games with pencils and colored beads!” Let’s see if we can find the basic machine learning ideas in this game.</p>
<h3 id="input-and-output">Input and output</h3>
<p>We begin with some input — the starting position. We must find the right output — the sequence of moves that will bring the machine to win the game. We must help the robot choose the right move at every possible position. Some moves are better than others, and we inform the robot about them using weights.</p>
<h3 id="weights">Weights</h3>
<p>In each position, we have several options for the next move. Depending on the game’s outcome, we can make certain move options more or less preferable for the next game (learning pass). Isn’t it similar to the weights we assign to certain neurons? Only in this case is it binary: you either leave the bead in the box (1) or remove it (0).</p>
<p>These days, we call it quantization, i.e., reducing the number of bits used by weights (e.g., from float32 to int8 and lower). In this case, each weight is exactly one bit, which tells us whether the bead is in the box or not.</p>
<h3 id="reinforcement-learning">Reinforcement learning</h3>
<p>Each time the machine gives you a wrong result, you adjust its weights. What is it, if not reinforcement learning? Environment, State, Agent, Action, Reward, right?</p>
<h3 id="backpropagation">Backpropagation</h3>
<p>Remember what you must do if only one bead is left in the box responsible for the last move? You can’t leave it empty, so you must apply the Reward (or, rather, the punishment) to the box responsible for the previous move. And so on and so forth. It looks like backpropagation, doesn’t it?</p>
<h2 id="going-further">Going further</h2>
<p>It’s pretty easy to play 30–40 games with the machine to make it invincible. Each game takes a few minutes, so we can achieve that result in less than an hour. But what if we could automate it? What if we could create a program to play the game and make two programs play against each other like they did with the Alpha Go program?</p>
<p>This sounds like a fun project that would be pretty easy to implement. But we are talking about ML and AI here, right? Why don’t we use AI to help us write this program?</p>
<p>I didn’t expect much when I entered the following prompt into ChatGPT.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are a Go programming expert. I will upload a file describing a simple chess-like game called Hexapawn. I want to write a program to implement this game. I must choose the data structures to store board positions and available (legal) moves in each position. Then, I have to implement the move and the whole game functions. Finally, I have to implement the learning procedure. Please help me develop this program. I have attached the PDF file with the game description.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And I uploaded the 15-page PDF that I linked at the very beginning.</p>
<p>I’ll tell you what happened next in the following article. Sorry, I couldn’t resist using this phrase. Also, ChatGPT told me that this article’s length is ideal and that I should stop writing immediately.</p>
<h2 id="other-works">Other works</h2>
<p>I discovered that I&rsquo;m not alone in making parallels between this simple game an Machine Learning principles.
After a quick search I found many interesting articles about using this game in teaching.
Here is a short list of articles.</p>
<p><strong>Pomona College</strong> uses it in the <a href="http://www.cs.pomona.edu/~kim/CSC062S07/labs/Lab6/HexAPawn.pdf">computer science labs</a></p>
<p><strong>Proceedings of Machine Learning Research</strong> directly addresses the idea of using the Hexapawn game in teaching Machine Learning: <a href="https://proceedings.mlr.press/v170/marx22a/marx22a.pdf">Using Matchboxes to Teach the Basics of Machine Learning: an Analysis of (Possible) Misconceptions</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Computd</strong> calls it <a href="https://computd.nl/hexapawn-accessible-machine-learning/">&ldquo;The accessible physical machine learning model&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p><strong>University of Wisconsin-Madison</strong> recommends Hexapawn as the <a href="https://education.mrsec.wisc.edu/hexapawn/">Introduction to Machine Learning</a> for students ages 11 and higher.</p>
<p><strong>Digital Business Development</strong> calls it <a href="https://dbd.au.dk/c/knowledge/tool-hexapawn-a-machine-learning-teaching-tool">a machine-learning teaching tool</a>.
They implemented a version of the game in <a href="https://bitbucket.org/aucbd/hexapawnts">JavaScript</a> but the game is not available online anymore.
Feel free to take the code and deploy it yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Mark Lawler</strong> wrote a story about <a href="https://mikesmathpage.wordpress.com/2017/09/03/intro-machine-learning-for-kids-via-martin-gardners-article-on-hexapawn/">showing this game to kids</a>.
He even recorded several videos of them playing the game and explaining it.</p>
