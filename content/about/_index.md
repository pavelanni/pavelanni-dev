# About Pavel Anni

I'm a **Technical Training Architect** who transforms complex distributed systems into learnable experiences. Currently at **MinIO**, I design training programs for enterprise object storage and AI infrastructure.

## What I Do

I build technical education that scales—from **Kubernetes training programs** delivered across 30+ countries to **hands-on labs** that teach distributed systems. My approach combines deep technical expertise with pedagogical design, creating learning experiences that stick.

**Current focus:** Go, Python, AI/LLM integration, Kubernetes, cloud-native systems, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) development.

## Recent Highlights

- **Built a production MCP server** for MinIO with 60+ functions and OAuth 2.1 authentication—enabling natural language interaction with object storage systems
- **Designed comprehensive training programs** for distributed storage solutions serving enterprise customers globally
- **Delivered 35+ Kubernetes training sessions** at SambaNova Systems while founding their technical documentation portal from zero
- **Author of "A Pythonic Adventure"** (Manning Publications)—a hands-on guide to Python programming

## Background

Over **35 years in tech**, I've trained thousands of engineers globally on technologies from Sun Microsystems infrastructure to Red Hat's OpenShift. I've been part of legendary teams (Sun Microsystems during its peak) and helped startups build their technical foundations (SambaNova Systems, MinIO).

**Education:** Master's in Solid State Physics from Moscow Engineering Physics Institute
**Certifications:** AWS Solutions Architect & Developer, Red Hat OpenShift, MinIO Accredited Field Architect

## Beyond Work

I tinker with **IoT projects** (check out my [GeekHouse automation system](/projects/geekhouse/)), explore **AI-assisted development**, and enjoy the intersection of hardware and software. When not coding, you might find me experimenting with amateur radio or building something with microcontrollers.
